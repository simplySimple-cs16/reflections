When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-->when u want to access ur file form remote devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-->When the remote update is out of context for my project working

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-->Several ways of copying (Branch, Clone and Fork)
Within a single repo --> branch
local to local --> clone
github to local --> clone
github to github --> fork 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--> U can reap the benefits of fast-forward merges i.e, if a branch with less commits is accessible by the branch with last known state then u can merge it with the earlier branch without any conflicts
